# chatbot
A Digital Assistant that interacts with the students and lecturers of a particular unit/course to let students log their work related to academics and to let lecturers track the progress of each student. This tool pushes the students to use their time effectively on academics.

The Chatbot helps in motivating the students by asking them to log their work every week ensuring that they are on track. This also helps teachers in accessing the logs such that the teachers view each students logs to analyse if the student is performing better or not. If they donâ€™t perform better, the teacher can track it easily and give suggetsions for the studnets to improve.
